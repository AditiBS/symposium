Title: "Urban Green Havens (UGH): Climate-Resilient Cities for Migrants"

Solution: Create sustainable, climate-resilient urban hubs in safe zones to absorb climate migrants. These cities will prioritize renewable energy, vertical farming, efficient public transport, and green infrastructure. Funded by a global climate adaptation fund, they will offer vocational training for green jobs, ensuring migrants thrive while reducing environmental strain.

Summary: UGH transforms migration into an opportunity by building eco-cities that combat urban sprawl, reduce emissions, and integrate displaced populations sustainably. A win-win for people and the planet.

Precious Response: "Let’s turn displacement into hope—building not just shelters, but thriving green communities for a resilient future." 🌱🏙️       .
